# Graph Board Status

Graph board is intentionally deferred from the revenue path.

## Current Status

- No graph editor UI shipped in this milestone.
- Preset type supports optional graph metadata (`Preset.graph`) for future use.
- Apply and merge behavior does not read graph metadata.

## Future Scope (Part 7)

- Introduce React Flow board for visual preset organization.
- Persist node/edge/viewport metadata only.
- Keep apply pipeline unchanged unless a future product decision adds execution semantics.
